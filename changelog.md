## [0.1.8] [Github repo]
### Added
- BASE_SERIAL_DEVICE and BASE_WS_DEVICE work in progress
## [0.1.7] - 2020-01-19 [Github repo]
### Fix
- W_UPYDEVICE kbi command can filter MicroPython banner info now
## [0.1.6] - 2020-01-10
### Added
- Reset option in "init" S_UPYDEVICE for upydev 'sh_srepl' compatibility
## [0.1.5] - 2020-01-07
### Added
- phantom_wr module like phantom but faster
### Fix
- KeyboardInterrupt handling in wr_cmd method of W_UPYDEVICE, S_UPYDEVICE, PYBOARD
## [0.1.4] - 2019-12-24
### Added
- New methods 'open_wconn', 'wr_cmd' and 'close_wconn' to open a wrepl session
and send commands (this will open a WebREPL connection and wont close it until
close_wconn is called, which means the other commands methods won't work) This
will drop the delay between sending a command and executing that command on the
device
- Methods 'open_wconn', 'wr_cmd' and 'close_wconn' for serial devices too.
(With serial REPL instead of WebREPL)
### Fix
- uparser_dec improved
## [0.1.3] - 2019-11-23
### Added
- Methods to UOS phantom class (mkdir, rmdir, getcwd, chdir, remove)
- Phantom pyb_Servo pyboard class
- New sensors IRQ phantom classes
## [0.1.2] - 2019-11-12
### Added
- New decorator (upy_cmd_c_r_in_callback) to be able to pass self methods (functions) as keywords arguments (for callbacks)
- New decorator that allows non-blocking function calls (upy_cmd_c_r_nb)
- New "IRQ_util.py" upy script (U_IRQ_MG class) + "Phantom" python IRQ_MG class
  This allow to manage/set interrupts, and receive and interrupt callback on python3 (see Phantom class Docs)
- New W_UPYDEVICE method 'is_reachable' (pings the device to see if it is
  reachable)
- New decorator (upy_cmd_c_r_nb_in_callback) to be able to pass self methods (functions) as keywords arguments (for callbacks) in non-blocking style
(good for timer interrupts)
- New "STREAMER_util.py" upy script (U_STREAMER class) as a "super" class to
  make streaming sensor data in real time easier (up to ~900 Hz of sampling frequency tested) + "Phantom" python STREAMER class (see Phantom class Docs)
- New phantom sensors classes (ADS1115, BME280, LSM9DS1)
- New phantom sensors STREAMER classes (IMU_STREAMER, BME_STREAMER,
  ADS_STREAMER)+ upydevice_utils scripts (IMU_util.py, ADS_util.py,
  BME_util.py) to test U_STREAMER and U_IRQ_MG classes (more about this in docs
  and examples)
## [0.1.1] - 2019-11-02
### Added
- phantom submodule, with some phantom classes (UOS, LSM9DS1, MACHINE, pyb_LED, pyb_Timer, machine_Timer, WLAN, AP, I2C)
- Now bytearray and array objects are supported

## [0.1.0] - 2019-10-29
###Â Added
- Now 'phantom' class methods allow to pass function in kwargs, this is useful to pass function to callbacks (for example Timers)
- option 'out' in class decorators that allows implement a function defined in micropython global space (main or dir()) as a part of a 'phantom' class

## [0.0.9] - 2019-10-28
### Added
- decorators for reusable 'phantom' classes
## [0.0.8] - 2019-10-28
### Fix
- decorators return option for commands that should return None
## [0.0.7] - 2019-10-28
### Added
- decorators for methods of 'phantom' python3 class

## [0.0.6] - 2019-10-27
### Added
- Non-blocking cmd_nb method
- methods and decorators to parse for/while loops and functions
- decorator to define a function as a shortcut to a function in MicroPython

## [0.0.5] - 2019-10-21
### Added
- GROUP class to send commands to a group of devices (one at a time or parallel)
- Name option parameter, and automatic naming (to make easier manage groups)
- 'Group silent' parameter and 'device silent' parameter to silence output
- Group output attribute, that catches the output of a group command and makes a dictionary like {device_1 :output_1, ..., device_n:output_n}
- Custom path indication with bundle_dir parameter at group creation (then no need to further indicate in cmd method)

## [0.0.4] - 2019-10-14
### Added
- Custom path indication with bundle_dir option in cmd method to indicate the path to the picocom binary for app development (command line or standalone) (For serial devices)

## [0.0.3] - 2019-09-28
### Added
- Silent option
- Custom path indication with bundle_dir option in cmd method to indicate the path to the web_repl_cmd_r binary for app development (command line or standalone) (For wireless devices)

## [0.0.2] - 2019-08-28
### Fix
- PYBOARD class commands output


## [0.0.1] - 2019-08-16
### Added
- First release
